<h1>WYMeditor</h1>
<h2>What is WYMeditor ?</h2>
<p><strong>WYMeditor</strong> is a web-based <acronym title="What You See Is What You Mean">WYSIWYM</acronym> editor.</p>
<p class="block"><strong>WYMeditor</strong>'s main concept is to leave details of the document's visual layout, and to concentrate on its structure and meaning, while trying to give the user as much comfort as possible (at least as <acronym title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym> editors).</p>
<p><strong>WYMeditor</strong> has been created to generate a perfectly structured <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> code, to conform to the W3C specifications and to facilitate further processing by modern applications.</p>
<p>With <strong>WYMeditor</strong>, the code can't be contaminated by visual informations like font styles and weights, borders, colors, ...<br />
The end-user defines content meaning ; this will then determine its rendering. The result is easy and quick maintenance of the information.</p>
<p>As the code is compliant to W3C specifications, you can for example process it using a <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation">XSLT</acronym> (at the client or the server side), giving you a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><strong>WYMeditor</strong> is released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php" title="About the M.I.T. license">Open Source MIT license</a> and is maintained by <a href="http://www.hovinne.com/" title="Jean-François Hovinne">Jean-François Hovinne</a> and <a href="http://www.pixarea.com/" title="Daniel Reszka">Daniel Reszka</a>. If you want to contribute, don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.wymeditor.org/" title="WYMeditor website">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a XHTML web-based editor which will be usable on many platforms, with the help of the Open Source Community.</p>
<p>WYMeditor has been initially created to be part of our own CMS, <a href="http://www.wymsite.org" title="WYMsite project homepage">WYMsite</a>, a XML-based Content Management System which tries to be easy to use and at the same time to conform to the W3C recommendations.</p>
