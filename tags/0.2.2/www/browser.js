/*************************************************************
Light version, use for basic browser detection only. Use our
http://techpatterns.com/downloads/javascript_browser_detection.txt script for more
complex javascript browser detection.

Remember, always use method or object testing as your first choice, for example, if ( dom ) { statement; };

Let me know if you find an error or a failure to properly detect, or if there
is a relevant browser that has special needs for detection at our tech forum:
http://techpatterns.com/forums/forum-11.html
The main script is separated from the initial netscape 4 detection due to certain bugs in
netscape 4 when it comes to unknown things like d.getElementById. The variable declarations
of course are made first to make sure that all the variables are global through the page, 
otherwise a javascript error will occur because you are trying to use an undeclared variable.

We test for basic browser type (ie, op, or moz/netscape > 6)..

here is a sample use of the browser detector, it would load a browser specific stylesheet
for certain unsupported or improperly supported mac ie 5 css styles. The depth variable
is used so that the javascript library file can be used from anywhere in the website, you simply
insert the depth of the file like this, 
...
 <head>
 <title>Browser information Page</title>

 <meta http-equiv = "Content-Type" content = "text/html; charset = iso-8859-1" />
 <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "/css/main.css" />
 <script type = "text/javascript" src = "/js/browser_detection.js"> </script>
 <script type = "text/javascript>browser_css( '/'); </script>
 </head>

in the head of the web page after the js file is loaded.
Or if you are always referring your site to the root, you wouldn't need that
 and could delete the depth variable and just use the absolute path to the root.

function browser_css( ) {
	d = document;// shorthand so we don't have to write out document each time..
	if ( ie5mac ) {
		d.write('<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text\/css" href = "/css/ie5mac.css" />');
	}
	else if ( d.layers ){
		d.write('<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text\/css" href = "/css/ns4x.css" />');
	}
	else if ( ie4 ){
		d.write('<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text\/css" href = "/css/ie4.css" />');
	}
	else if ( moz ){
		d.write('<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text\/css" href = "/css/moz.css" />');
	}
	else {
		d.write('< link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text\/css" href = "/css/moz5.css" />');
	}
